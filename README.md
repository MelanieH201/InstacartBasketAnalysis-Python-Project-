# Python Project: Instacart Basket Analysis
###### This was a python project I did while enrolled with Career Foundry. I was an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. My task was to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of Instacart data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 
###### Key questions were as follows: 
###### 1. The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the days are (days and times with most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders. 
###### 2. They also want to know wheter there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money. 
###### 3. Instacart has a lot of product with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts. 
###### 4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders. 
###### 5. The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example: 
######    What's the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty? 
######    Are there diffferences in ordering habites based on a cutomer's loyalty status? 
######    Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
